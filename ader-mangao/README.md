TITLE :  AN A.R APPLICATION TO VIEW CAN BE PLACED INSIDE A NEW HOME USING A PHONE SCREEN
a.)	Project Description.
	Most people who renovate their homes pay for interior designer for the good design of their home, so I made an A.R Application so they don't have to pay for interior designer because they themselves can choose what they want to designer inside their home.
b.)	 Market Analysis.
	The project targets those with new homes, people who renovate their homes, can also be interior designers so they don't have to think about what they're signing.
c.)	Technical Specification.
	You will choose the type of house design you want after viewing the various options in this program application. After selecting a design, you can change any object with one that suits into your preferences.
d.)	 Risk Analysis.
	Maybe the only problem with my A.R Application would be if the designs that would be shown on their cellphone screens wouldn't be liked.
