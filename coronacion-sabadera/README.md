LeARn: A Web Augmented Reality for Learning Body Organs

a)	Project Description
This project allows the student to learn the different Body Organs in a 3d form where they can zoom in and see up close the parts of organ. The web AR uses a camera to scan an image and then the 3d model of the organ shows. And when you touch the 3d form it will make a sound that explain the brief definition of that body organ.

b)	Market Analysis
This project aims to provide a fun learning for the young students like in elementary. It also helps the teachers, they can use the AR as an aide material for their lesson. And the advantage of the web AR is that it can be accessed by students and teachers whenever they wanted to.

c)	Risk Analysis
The potential risk of this project is that creating web AR is challenging and lacks virtual ongoing professional development. The development of an educational AR system is time consuming. The teaching experience might be a risk too, some teachers are insufficient training for dealing with technology.
